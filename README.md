## Requirements
- Our system is called Delicious Snacks. It can be understood simply that 
a website was born to assist users (who are website visitors) to be able to 
conveniently review and order the foods on the website screen. Besides, 
this app supports a dashboard for the admin. The website has three roles: 
guest, admin, and members.
- The common functions for all roles (guest/member) :
  * Search snacks by their name or category
  * View information of snacks
  * Buy snacks
- The member functions after login:
  * Log out to the system
  * View himself/herself orders ( all days, or filter from date to date). 
  * Cancel the order ( only cancel orders whose status is processing)
  * Order again (only perform on orders whose status was canceled)
  * Change his/her profile
- The admin functions after login:
  * Manage accounts: view all accounts, block/unblock an account
  * View all orders, filter orders between from date and to date, filter orders of any customer.
  * Manage snacks ( view,create,update snacks)
  * Manage categories: view, create, update
  * Log out
